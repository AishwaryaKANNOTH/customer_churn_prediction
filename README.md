# customer_churn_prediction

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project works on predicting customer churn by combining machine learning with business intelligence. I used Python to build churn prediction models and Power BI to create a dashboard with actionable insights.

Key Focus Areas:

Churn prediction using machine learning

Feature analysis and interpretation

Storytelling with Power BI

Business recommendations based on model insights

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Customer churn directly impacts revenue, especially in subscription-based industries like telecom. My objective was to:

Predict which customers are most likely to churn

Identify behavior and service patterns that lead to churn

Visualize churn risk and suggest data-driven retention strategies

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
Telco Customer Churn â€“ Kaggle Dataset
This dataset includes:

Demographics

Service subscriptions

Account and billing data

Final churn status

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

Data Cleaning	using Python, Pandas
EDA & Modeling using	Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
Machine Learning using Logistic Regression, Random Forest
BI Dashboard using Power BI

KPIs: Total customers, churn risk %, predicted churners

Churn Insights:

Higher churn among short-tenure, high-monthly-charge users

No tech support and electronic payment linked to higher risk


ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
Short-tenured customers are most at risk

Support engagement plays a major role in loyalty

Customers paying by electronic check show higher churn risk

Churn probability increases as monthly charges increase
